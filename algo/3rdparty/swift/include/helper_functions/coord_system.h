 *
 * @details Converts from WGS84 Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian
 * coordinates (X, Y and Z) into WGS84 geodetic coordinates (latitude,
 * longitude and height).
 *
 * Conversion from Cartesian to geodetic coordinates is a much harder problem
 * than conversion from geodetic to Cartesian. There is no satisfactory closed
 * form solution but many different iterative approaches exist.
 *
 * Here we implement a relatively new algorithm due to Fukushima (2006) that is
 * very computationally efficient, not requiring any transcendental function
 * calls during iteration and very few divisions. It also exhibits cubic
 * convergence rates compared to the quadratic rate of convergence seen with
 * the more common algortihms based on the Newton-Raphson method.
